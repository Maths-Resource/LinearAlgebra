MA4003 Jacobi Method Q7b

Autumn 2009/2009

By considering the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix, or otherwise, show that the Jacobi method is guaranteed to converge for the system

of linear equations 

 


 =                 in form :Ax=b


Use three (3) iterations of the method, with initial guess x1(0) = 0; x2(0) = 0; x3(0) = 0, to obtain a numerical solution of the system.

D is a matrix composed of the diagonal elements of A





To determine whether the method is convergent for A, we need to find the eigenvalues of G



Solve  Characteristic Equation to find eigenvalues



Eigenvalues of G               

Jacobi Method is convergent if <1

              Therefore the Jacobi Method is Convergent
